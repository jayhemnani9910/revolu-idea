# Impact of remote work on productivity (demo)

**Generated:** 2025-12-18 00:00  
**Methodology:** Demo-only sample output (CAG structure preview)  
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Findings:** 4 (50.0% verified)

## Summary

This demo shows the *shape* of a typical CAG output: a short summary, a few sections, and a list of
verdict-tagged findings. In a real run, each claim is backed by citations and evidence objects.

## Background

Remote work can change team communication, focus time, and access to talent. The real system would
collect sources, extract claims, and run an audit loop to identify gaps or unsupported statements.

### Key Findings

- [VERIFIED] Productivity impact is not uniform; it varies by role, tooling, and meeting load.  
- [CONTESTED] Fully remote always increases productivity compared to hybrid arrangements.  

## Operational takeaways

This is where you’d see actionable recommendations derived from verified findings.

### Key Findings

- [VERIFIED] Strong async practices reduce coordination overhead for distributed teams.  
- [UNVERIFIED] A single policy works well for every team without exceptions.
